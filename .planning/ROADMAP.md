### Phase 6: Polish and Production Features

**Goal:** Complete the Amp-faithful experience with $EDITOR, history, @mentions, mouse support, config, and error handling.

**Requirements:** POL-01, POL-02, POL-03, POL-04, POL-05, POL-06

**Success Criteria:**
1. Ctrl+G suspends TUI, opens $EDITOR with prompt, resumes TUI with edited text

5. Errors display gracefully in TUI without crashing
