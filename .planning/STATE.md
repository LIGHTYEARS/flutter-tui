## Recent Activity

- 2026-03-26: v0.1.0 milestone complete (Phases 1-6)

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Context |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2026-03-26 | Use @agentclientprotocol/sdk v0.16.0 | Standard protocol for multi-agent support |
| 2026-03-26 | Build on flitter-core widgets | Consistent with monorepo architecture |
| 2026-03-26 | Ctrl+Enter submits (multi-line default) | Matches Amp CLI behavior |
| 2026-03-27 | Fix all 5 layers systematically | Tactical fixes proved endless; need structured approach |
| 2026-03-27 | Guardrail: 3+ fix failures → deep research | Prevent surface-level fixes that miss root causes |

## Known Issues

See REQUIREMENTS.md for full v0.2.0 defect list (25 items across Protocol, Scroll, Streaming, Tool, UX layers).

## Accumulated Context

- `PaintContext.drawChar` expects `CellStyle` (`fg`/`bg`); `TextStyle` (`foreground`/`background`) must be converted at the widget-to-render-object boundary.
- Terminal size detection defaults to 80x24 in certain environments if `process.stdout.columns` is not correctly accessed.
- Headless grid tests can pass while real TUI output is broken if test helpers are more permissive than the renderer's SGR builder.
