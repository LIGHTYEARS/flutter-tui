# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22)

**Core value:** Flutter-faithful TUI framework with declarative widgets, box-constraint layout, and 60fps cell-level diff rendering
**Current focus:** v1.1 Amp CLI Feature Parity — defining requirements

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.0]: Integer coordinates everywhere (terminal cells are discrete)
- [v1.0]: Immutable Widget, mutable Element/RenderObject (Flutter-faithful)
- [v1.0]: Synchronous frame pipeline (BUILD->LAYOUT->PAINT->RENDER)
- [v1.0]: Cell-level diff for minimal ANSI output
- [v1.0]: Zero runtime dependencies
- [v1.1]: Kitty/Sixel image protocol deferred to v2 (not needed for core Amp parity)

### Pending Todos

- Gap analysis completed — 11 missing widgets, 3 missing InheritedWidgets, 20+ missing RenderObject features identified
- login-form stack overflow bug fixed (self-referential build guard in StatelessElement.rebuild)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
